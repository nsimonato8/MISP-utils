# MISP-utils

This repository contains some python scripts that can be useful to manage a [MISP](https://misp-project.org/) platform.

## TaxonomiesChecker

This command line tool can be helpful to determine if a taxonomy (encoded in a `machinetag.json` file) is correct, by providing some feedbacks on why it might not be valid. It's possible to silence the outputs by adding the
`-s` flag.
